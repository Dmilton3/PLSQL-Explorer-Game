In order to run these scripts, you will need to use a command line database system able to run sql scripts. 
I used sqlplus to run this and visual studio code to write. 
First start exp_ex; this will drop all tables and create all tables needed for this simulation 
Next start move_log; this will create a stored procedure to capture each move and review after the sim is done
Next start testDriver; or test; When you want to start over, just start exp_ex to reset everything. 
Thank you!
